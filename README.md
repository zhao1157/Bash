# Bash
## ========== 1. Learning_Bash/learning_bash.sh

### My learning philosophy: 
1. Practice the syntax of the new language and test my understanding of it by putting it into various situations; 
2. Integrate what I have leant with the new piece I'm learning to improve my understanding and view of the new language; 
3. Compare with other languages I have learnt and try to solve some similar problems encountered before with the new language.

### My goals: 
1. Be familiar with and  master the new language; 
2. Through writing codes and testing of them, take good notes of the new language; 
3. Form my own syntax library of the new language for future review.

## ========== 2. Generate_Letter_Grade/Process_Grade.sh
This script is used to read all the scores from the grade sheets of a few quizzes, and give the right letter grades.
***

## ========== 3. Combine_PIX/xcombine.sh
This script is to combine all the photoionization cross section data of all the transitions into a single file.

***

## ========== 4. Stg2_Core_e_SLP/{\*}
These scripts are what I used to create the input file for stg2 RM calculation.

***

## ========== 5. Recupd_Core_2J_Pi/recupd_core_2j_p.sh
This script is used to create the input file for stage recupd in RM calculation

***
## ========== 6. BB_FAC_SS/{\*}
These scripts are used to convert bound-bound FAC data into RM format.

***
## ========== 7. Combine_BB_FAC_SS/{\*}
These scripts are sued to combine the bound-free FAC data of different transitions into one in RM format.

***

## ========== 8. Generate_PIX/{\*}
This script is part of codes for generating the final p-file needed to calculate the opacity. The rest of codes can be found in the folder
of the same name in reposities Python and Gawk.

***
## ========== 9. Add_Levels_454/{\*}
Along with the c-code in C/Add_Levels_454/, these scripts manage to obtain the final FAC data for each bound level.

***

## ========== 10. Combine_FAC_RM_454/{\*}
These codes are part of generating the final photoionization cross section data for 454 levels. The core code is in C/Combine_FAC_RM_454.
